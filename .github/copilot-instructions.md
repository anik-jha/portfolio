description: 'Always refer to the project plan and memory settings.'

# Project Context
Always use the information and guidelines provided in the following files for all tasks:
*   [Project Plan](portfolio_plan.md)
*   [Memory Settings](project_settings.md)

Ensure all actions and responses align with the details in these documents.

## Conversation Memory (Required)
- Always load and respect the file `.github/conversation_memory.md` at the start of every session.
- After each meaningful change or decision, append a brief, dated summary to that file so work continues smoothly across restarts.
- If the memory file is missing, create it with an initial summary and the current date.

This is the canonical source for cross-session continuity. Treat it as authoritative alongside `portfolio_plan.md` and `project_settings.md`.

## Create new files instructions
 - dont create new readme files or summary documents unless explicitly asked for
