# Assets Folder

Place your blog post images here. The blog posts reference images like:

- `ols_vs_qr_median.png`
- `qr_lines.png` 
- `ols_vs_qr_flow_detailed.png`
- `pinball_loss_shapes.png`
- etc.

You can either:
1. Add the actual images here
2. Update the markdown files to reference different image URLs
3. Leave as-is and the placeholder boxes will show

The placeholders are styled to be informative and don't break the reading experience.
