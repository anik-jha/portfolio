**WORK EXPERIENCE:**

**Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Rocket Mortgage** <span style="float: right;">**Aug’21 – Present**</span>
*   Spearheaded the design and adoption of a standardized ML project template and deployment pipeline, establishing team-wide best practices for reproducibility, monitoring, and CI/CD, which significantly streamlined the path from experimentation to production.
*   Designed and productionized a scalable, batch predictive modeling system to forecast loan response times, integrating model inference directly into the client-facing portal. This deployment reduced client status calls by 78% and enhanced operational transparency.
*   Designed the system architecture for an automated loan prioritization workflow, standardizing a manual, multi-step process that previously required 15 minutes per pass, multiple times a day. The deployed system integrates a human-in-the-loop (HITL) interface for verification, reducing manual effort by 80%.
*   Designed and implemented a cascaded Deep Learning model architecture for image-based mortgage document processing, dramatically reducing processing time from days to minutes through intelligent filtering and information extraction.
*   Mentored and provided technical guidance to data analysts and software engineers, fostering career growth and team scalability by imparting ML concepts, tools, and best practices.
*   Collaborated with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to define project vision, roadmap, and team agreements, ensuring alignment on roles and responsibilities and fostering a culture of accountability and productivity.

**Machine Learning Engineer, Imagry Inc.** <span style="float: right;">**Sep’18 – Aug’21**</span>
*   Led the effort to develop a continuous learning paradigm for the path prediction model to learn from cases on the road resulting in interventions, without having to manually label the data.
*   Implemented and enhanced advanced neural-network based methodologies using PyTorch for predicting adjacent vehicle trajectories, critical for self-driving car safety and decision-making.
*   Devised and integrated sections of motion planning algorithms, enabling self-driving cars to incorporate surrounding traffic behaviors for safer and more adaptive driving decisions. 
*   Fine-tuned Deep Learning networks for classifying pedestrian behaviors in urban environments, enhancing in-car experience and safety near sidewalks and crosswalks through advanced image processing. 
*   Delivered engaging client demonstrations of self-driving car technology, effectively communicating key features and value propositions to drive adoption and strengthen client relationships.

**Decision/Data Scientist, Mu Sigma Inc.** <span style="float: right;">**Jul’14 – Nov’16**</span>
*   Led a team of 3 data scientists to design and implement an automated real-time error prioritization tool, slashing daily error counts by over 75% and significantly improving operational efficiency and process management.
*   Trained and mentored 40+ graduate new hires, imparting technical skills and best practices to accelerate onboarding and foster team success, demonstrating a deep ability to teach and guide. 
*   Performed Natural Language Processing (NLP) on client survey data to derive actionable insights into customer and agency satisfaction and pain points for an insurance client. 
*   Conducted comprehensive comparative market analysis to identify strategic opportunities for improvement across client and competitor purchase funnels, informing business strategy and potential service expansion
